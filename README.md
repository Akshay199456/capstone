# One Stop Search

# Hi everyone! Welcome to my Capstone Project!!!

This project is called 'One Stop Search'. For this project, I wanted to build an application that was actually relevant given the ton of information that our digital footprints leave us with today. With **One Stop Search**, you can get the relevant information you need depending on the query entered by the user. For example, if you wanted to search for *cats*, you would get results from different platforms for cats.

Currently, the applications supports 6 different platforms divided across 3 different categories:

1. Entertainment
- YouTube
- Tumblr

2. News
- News API
- New York Times
- Tech Crunch

3. Music
- YouTube Music (part of YouTube API)
- Last.fm

Based on the results obtained, you can analyze the results across different platforms and categories. Each platform also has other additional results that can be viewed which is unique to that plaform. 


## Technologies used:

React was used to design the front end of the application while the backend was designed using Express. In order to store the results, mongoDB was used. 

In addition, React-Vis was used to analyze the results across different categories and platforms in the form of a pie graph. Semantic UI was used to add responsive feautes to the website. Google Font was used to add font styles to the text shown. FontAwesome was used to add icons. 


## UserStories:

## Unsolved problems and future additions:

My initial plan was to create a 6v6 pokemon game where the user could change his pokemon in between the battle of the game. However, as I began working on the project, I began to understand that I would not be able to implement a few features that I had initially planned because of the time frame. As a result, there are a few features that I would love to implement into this project in my free time and make it an expanded game:

	1. Add the ability to choose 6 pokemon for the player.
	2. Change the pokemon mid-battle and if the player pokemon dies.
	3. Add more pokemon to choose from for the player and the computer.
	4. Add more pokemon types to choose from for the player and the computer.
	5. Add animations & sound effects when a pokemon attacks, gets attacked or faints.
	6. Add more attacking abilities to the pokemon.
	7. Make it a 2 player game
	8. Add more interactive text between the player and computer.
