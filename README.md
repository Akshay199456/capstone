# One Stop Search

# Hi everyone! Welcome to my Capstone Project!!!

This project is called 'One Stop Search'. For this project, I wanted to build an application that was actually relevant given the ton of information that our digital footprints leave us with today. With **One Stop Search**, you can get the relevant information you need depending on the query entered by the user. For example, if you wanted to search for *cats*, you would get results from different platforms for cats.

Currently, the applications supports 6 different platforms divided across 3 different categories:

1. Entertainment
- YouTube
- Tumblr

2. News
- News API
- New York Times
- Tech Crunch

3. Music
- YouTube Music (part of YouTube)
- Last.fm



This project is called the "Pokemon Battle" game. I think many of us played "Pokemon Red" and "Pokemon Blue" growing up. Ah, those good times! I fell in love with those games as they created a beautiful experience even though they had simplistic graphics and logic. As a result, I wanted to recreate a part of that experience with the project that we had to complete. To me, the best part of that experience was the pokemon battling scene which is what I decided to work on for the project game.

The game is simple. You choose one pokemon out of 6 pokemon to fight against the computer's pokemon. Currently, the 6 choices include 2 grass, fire and water pok√©mon respectively. The computer's pokemon is selected out of random from another group of 6 pokemon again having the 2 grass, 2 fire and 2 water pokemon. Each pokemon is strong and weak against other pokemon types. "Fire" is weak against "Water" and strong against "Grass". "Water" is weak against "Grass" and strong against "Fire". "Grass" is weak against "Fire" and strong against "Water".


## Technologies used:

The basic technologies used in this game include the html, css and js files. In addition, I have also used "FontAwesome" for icons, "Google Font" to display the different fonts used in the game and jQuery for element selection. 


## Approach taken:

To recreate the game, it involves a play by play turn against the computer. Based on the player's pokemon that is chosen in pokemonSelection.html, the stats associated with that pokemon is loaded into the local storage and is then retrieved later in the battle.html file. On the other hand, the stats associated with the computer pokemon is generated at random from a collection of 6 pokemon. This data is then transferred to the result.html file depending on the winner of the game.

## Unsolved problems and future additions:

My initial plan was to create a 6v6 pokemon game where the user could change his pokemon in between the battle of the game. However, as I began working on the project, I began to understand that I would not be able to implement a few features that I had initially planned because of the time frame. As a result, there are a few features that I would love to implement into this project in my free time and make it an expanded game:

	1. Add the ability to choose 6 pokemon for the player.
	2. Change the pokemon mid-battle and if the player pokemon dies.
	3. Add more pokemon to choose from for the player and the computer.
	4. Add more pokemon types to choose from for the player and the computer.
	5. Add animations & sound effects when a pokemon attacks, gets attacked or faints.
	6. Add more attacking abilities to the pokemon.
	7. Make it a 2 player game
	8. Add more interactive text between the player and computer.
